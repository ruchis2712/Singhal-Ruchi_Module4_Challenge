# Singhal-Ruchi_Module4_Challenge
Pandas used for the analysis

## The code in the Jupyter Notebook file analyzes the schools and students data from a ditrict and provides the following information:


(1.) A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format

(2.) An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format

(3.) Tables presenting each of the following metrics: 

     - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
     
     - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
     
     - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
     
     - School performance based on the budget per student
     
     - School performance based on the school size 
     
     - School performance based on the type of school
     

### The code also corrects student names in the students dataset and removes erroneous math and reading scores of 9th grade of Thomson High School


### The text file in the repository provides answers to the following questions analyzing the impact of removing Thomson High School scores:

Q1. How is the district summary affected?

Q2. How is the school summary affected?

Q3. How does removing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance, relative to the other schools?

Q4. How does removing the ninth-grade scores affect the Math and Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, and Scores by School Type?
